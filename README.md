The eaisiest way to install is to directly download from the releases tab.
Once you download it it's click-and-run, no fuss!
This is *Does Not* install to your computer and if you delete it, there is no other file to delete.

## Install

There is no way to actually *install* the program on your computer.
A installer may come in the future.
